# QuickRequest
QuickRequest is a Discord bot that runs on the Crafting For Christ Network Discord that manages requests for access to our white-listed servers on our Network.
Initially developed in under 2 hours to handle requests for the RLCraft server that was launched at that time.
QuickRequest has now been updated and is more capable to handle requests from multiple servers.

## How to Request?
To request access you need to join our [Discord](https://craftingforchrist.net/discord) if you haven't already.

Currently there are 2 white-listed servers on our Network which you can find more information about this on our [Play ](https://craftingforchrist.net/play) page.

To request access the syntax is following `!request SERVER USERNAME`
Example: `!request revelation shadowolfyt`
Use this in a Discord channel to submit a request for access and a Senior Staff member will look over it and either accept or deny your request.
*NOTE:* You will not be notified if your request for access has been denied.
